# Cruiseline_and_Airline-system
Test-based UI to interact with both types of subsystems by adding and booking flights/cruises. The airport system can be imported from a text file and exported to one in order to be used at a later time.

The client.java contains main with which the user works through. The AMS.txt file has a certain format in which if an airport system were to
be created from the file of that format it would do so without error. When an airport system is then exported to a file, it is done so in the same format
so that the user could reopen it at a later date and continue on with the same system they left off on.
